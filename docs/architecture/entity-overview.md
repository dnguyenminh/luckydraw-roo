# Entity System Overview

## Architecture Overview

The entity system is built using a layered architecture:

### 1. Core Layer
- Base interfaces
- Abstract classes  
- Common utilities
- Core contracts

### 2. Domain Layer
- Entity models
- Value objects
- Domain events
- Business rules

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- Data persistence
- Event publishing
- Caching
- Transactions

### 4. Application Layer
- Entity services
- Event handlers
- Operation coordinators
- Business workflows

## System Components

### 1. Entity Models

Core domain entities:
- Users and profiles
- Resources and assets  
- Configuration items
- Audit records

### 2. Base Classes

Foundational components:
- EntityModel interface
- AbstractEntity base
- Status management
- Validation support

### 3. Supporting Services 

Infrastructure services:
- Data repositories
- Event publishers
- Cache providers
- Transaction handlers

### 4. Cross-Cutting

Common functionality:
- Validation
- Exception handling
- Event processing  
- State management

## Integration Points

### 1. External Systems
- Authentication services
- Notification systems
- Reporting tools
- Monitoring services

### 2. Internal Services
- Business services
- Domain services
- Infrastructure services
- Application services

## Best Practices

### 1. Entity Design
- Clear boundaries
- Single responsibility
- Rich domain model
- Immutable where possible

### 2. State Management  
- Explicit states
- Valid transitions
- Event publishing
- History tracking

### 3. Data Handling
- Repository pattern
- Unit of work
- Clear contracts
- Optimistic locking

### 4. Error Processing
- Specific exceptions
- Error mapping
- Recovery paths
- Proper logging
